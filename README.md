# Xpensia - Yours own expense tracker web application
Xpensia is a full-stack application launched to help users track their income, manage expenses, and monitor budget limits for various categories. The app features functionality for setting budget limits, adding, updating, and deleting expenses, and visualizing data using charts. Alerts notify users when their spending exceeds predefined thresholds, ensuring better financial management.

## Key features

- User Authentication: Secure login and registration functionality.
- Budget Categories: Set category-wise budget limits (income, savings, etc.).
- Expense Management: Add, edit, update and delete expenses.
- Cutomized alert system: Replaces default alert system to match the UI.
- Alerts: Get customized alerts at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% of income usage.
- Expense Summary: View a detailed summary of expenses, total income, and remaining balance.
- Data Visualization: Bar chart representation of expenses.
- PDF Reports: Generate and download a PDF report of monthly expenses.
- Expense Reports: Monthly expense report generation.
- RESTful API: Backend API to handle all data storage and retrieval via MongoDB.

## Tech stacks
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose for schema modeling)
- Charts: Recharts
- PDF Generation: jsPDF

## Future Enhancements

- Implement recurring expenses.
- Add pie chart visualization for category-wise expense distribution.
- Implement push notifications for income usage alerts.

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the developers of React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB for the amazing tools that make this project possible.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
